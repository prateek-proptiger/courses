Questions:

1. Difference between babel and babel-node.
Babel (transpiler) is used to compile js files to the version supported bu current browsers. babel-cli is used to access babel features on cli.
It comes with a second CLI (babel-node) as well which works exactly similar to Node.js's CLI only it will compile ES6 code using defined presets/plugins before running it.
Not meant for use on production as it is unnecessarily heavy with high memory usage due to the cache being stored in memory.

2. process.exit() and process.exitCode
- The process.exit() method instructs Node.js to terminate the process synchronously with an exit status of code.
- A number which will be the process exit code, when the process either exits gracefully, or is exited via process.exit() without specifying a code. 0 - 'success' and 1 - 'failure'.

3. del
A module used to delete files and folders using globs. It is similar to 'rimraf' but with a promise API and support for multiple files.
