Isomorphic - An app whose code can run on both client and server.
Need to understand the basics of first request coming to server whereas the later ones being processed at the client itself.
1. Debugging is trickier
2. Bye bye jQuery = Because there is no DOM on server
3. Taking into account where the code would run
4. Avoid exposing sensitive data
5. Managing settings
